Exercise 1: Leap Year Checker
Write a program that takes a year as input from the user and checks whether it is a Leap Year or not.

Leap Year Criteria: A year is a Leap Year if it is divisible by 4, except for century years (ending in 00), which must also be divisible by 400.
Sample Input: 2024
Sample Output: 2024 is a Leap Year.
'''
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if year%400==0 or year%4==0 and year%100!=0:
    print(f"{year} is a Leap Year")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a Leap Year")
